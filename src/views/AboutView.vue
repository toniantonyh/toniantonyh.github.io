          Who is Tomislav Hrabrić
        </h2>

        <p>
	  Tomislav Hrabrić is a Serbian painter who has been working in the
	  direction of figurative abstraction and virtual waves for over two
	  decades. Born in Belgrade in August 1970, he is an autodidact who
	  began painting at a young age. His work is characterized by a deep
	  understanding of the emotional and symbolic aspects of virtual waves.

          Figurative abstraction invokes the imagination
        </h2>

        <p>
	  Virtual waves, also known as computer-generated waves, are a visual
	  representation of the movement of water that is created using computer
	  software. In his art, Tomislav explores the unique aesthetic and emotional
	  qualities of virtual waves, using them as a subject matter and as a medium
	  to express his thoughts, feelings and emotions.

          Techniques that challenge mind and perception
        </h2>

        <p>
	  Tomislav often uses a mix of mediums and techniques to create evocative
	  pieces that challenge the viewer's perception of reality. The figurative
	  abstraction approach he is using in his art is a form of abstraction that
	  references the real world while still being non-representational. It's a
	  way of expressing the artist's emotions, thoughts and feelings, in a more
	  metaphorical and symbolic way, rather than a literal one. His approach
	  to painting is direct and spontaneous, throwing the paint onto canvases
	  resulting in thick impasto and intense surfaces of vibrant abstract
	  compositions. He also uses custom-made tools like palette knives to
	  create a unique texture and depth in his work.

          Constant push towards new horizons
        </h2>

        <p>
	  Tomislav has been an active member of the Artists Association of Serbia
	  and Diaspora Belgrade since 2015. He has participated in many group
	  exhibitions of the association, showcasing his work to a wider audience,
	  including a solo exhibit at the Mona Lisa Gallery in Paris. His work has
	  been widely recognized and praised by critics and art lovers alike.
	  Tomislav Hrabrić continues to push the boundaries of figurative abstraction
	  in painting of virtual waves, creating thought-provoking and powerful works
	  that stand out in the contemporary art scene.
