          Introduction
        </h2>

        <p>
          We believe that the modern world is broken: social media fame values that lead to painful experiences, broken
          lives, and unhappiness. People hunt for expensive brands, luxury, and abundant consumption.

          Our Mission
        </h2>

        <p>
          We inspire to help: we believe in a better world where people spend money not to buy expensive goods to
          impress someone but spend their wealth on helping people and inspire others to do the same.

          The movement
        </h2>

        <p>
          We will build a community of people who share our values and want to live their lives, changing the world and
          making a real impact. We believe that the members of our community will be our ambassadors who will form the
          Movement for the Good of Humanity and a better world.

          The platform
        </h2>

        <p>
          We will create a platform with personal profiles showing investments into helping other people, charity, and
          improving the world.
          The more people see others investing their money for better purposes, the more people will join them.
          We want these profiles to become new evidence of success and prestigious consumption rather than buying
          branded clothes or sports cars.

          WePurpose Pay
        </h2>

        <p>
          We will connect the Platform to the brands that wish to improve the world and allow their clients to
          participate. The Platform will record each dollar transferred to the platform and accumulate these tokens in
          the personal profiles of those who have spent these dollars. The more money you have transferred, the more
          impact you make and the more valuable your contribution to helping others.
          For these means, we will create WePurpose Pay - a non-profit payment provider that will serve as an
          authorization and payment method on the shopping websites and will automatically share a part of the retailer
          revenue to the WePurpose Profile of the person who has spent the money.

          Charity partners
        </h2>

        <p>
          The money transferred to the Platform can be spent only on the Platform for helping others directly or with
          the help of trustworthy organizations that provide traceable results of the spending. The community of the
          contributors will be able to vote for the purposes and organizations the money to be transferred to.

          Traceability
        </h2>

        <p>
          We will provide obvious and traceable data on all the spending for each dollar transferred to the platform.
          The money spent on helping others will be permanently connected to the person who has spent it (or
          organization/family).

          Promotion
        </h2>

        <p>
          We will endorse any influencers for spreading the word about the Platform and WePurpose Movement vision. We
          also plan to use the power of the Community to encourage shopping platforms and brands to use WePurpose Pay
          and support the WePurpose Platform.

          Platform costs
        </h2>

        <p>
          We do not plan to make any profit on the platform or Token - it is solely aimed at creating a better future
          for Humanity. However, we think that some investment in the platform would help expand its impact, and we will
          allow the community to vote for it as an alternative to other ways of spending the money.

        <p>
          We believe in the power of Democracy and plan to give the right to manage the Platform to the community by
          electing a Management Board that shares the Vision and the Values of our Movement and will implement the ideas
          of this Whitepaper in the best possible way.
